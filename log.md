# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started React.js development - button increment application using props

**Thoughts:** React.js has been the tech stack that I have been wanting to dive into for a while. I have done little bits with it here and there but never dived into the deep theory and fundamentals. I started with a simple button application that increments the output by either 1, 5, 10 or 100 and I am very happy with the progress. I have used state and props with the application. I have a better understanding today than yesterday and I am excited to see what I look into tomorrow. I am looking into creating a github card application which will look at API calls.
