# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started React.js development - button increment application using props

**Thoughts:** React.js has been the tech stack that I have been wanting to dive into for a while. I have done little bits with it here and there but never dived into the deep theory and fundamentals. I started with a simple button application that increments the output by either 1, 5, 10 or 100 and I am very happy with the progress. I have used state and props with the application. I have a better understanding today than yesterday and I am excited to see what I look into tomorrow. I am looking into creating a github card application which will look at API calls.

### Day 2: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued React development with Github card challenge.

**Thoughts:** I looked over the button increment challenge from yesterday and was happy with the logic and syntax. I then moved onto the Github card challenge, which was quite tough to get my head around in some aspects. There were a lot of moving parts throughout the project. I enjoyed having test data to use and then when I got the first card to appear, I may have let out a little smile. 

Using the map function was nice as it is fun in JS, so to bring that over was good for me. I enjoyed reading more into the parameters for the map function, taking the variable I will use later and then the index for each new element. 

All in all it has been a successful day and I am very happy with the progress. I think I will take another look at the increment and perhaps create a decrement button, just for fun.
